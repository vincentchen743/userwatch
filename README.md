# Userwatch Engineering Challenge
# Task
Identify a user by how they type text.

We have provided a collection of text passages. For any user session with your app, you should display a random one of those text passages, a text box, a text area and a button. Ask the user to type their name into the text box, then type out the passage into the text area. They should hit the button once done.

Once the user is done and has hit the button, your app should show the name/s of who their typing is most similar to.
# Requirements
The Userwatch team must be able to:
- See and run your code
- Works on one client platform of your choice
    - Web (JS/Typescript)
    - Android (Kotlin/Java)
    - iOS (Swift/ObjC)
    - Any language is fine for the backend.
# Bonuses
- Consider details like the timing between letter pairs for more effective matching across strings.
- Determine typing similarity live, rather than only once it is complete.
- Userwatch team can load and run your application via browser or app install
- Only if practical and free!
- Design and implementation facilitate future modification to address specific over-matching and under-matching examples.
- Practical setup for evaluating whether your algorithmic changes improve or reduce quality.
# Not expected
- Dealing with more than one client platform
- Storing data in any particularly robust way, use whatever is expedient even if it doesn’t scale (eg. in memory) 
- Perfect detection, we’re interested in your overall engineering approach not just the precision and accuracy.
- Expected time commitment

A couple of sessions of at most a few hours each. If you have spent a whole weekend on it that is definitely too much!
